			<h2>Camp Kesem</h2>
			<p class="text">To put it simply, Kesem has my whole heart.<br><a href="https://www.campkesem.org/find-a-camp/camp-kesem-at-duke-university">Camp Kesem</a> is a national non-profit run by college students that supports children through and beyond a parent's cancer.</p>
			<p class="text">What exactly does that mean? Duke University's chapter provides a free week of summer camp to local children affected by a parent's cancer. Seeing campers transform into the most confident and compassionate versions of themselves is truly magical, and Camp Kesem is one of the best organizations I've been a part of.</p>
