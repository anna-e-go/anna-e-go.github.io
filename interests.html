			<h2>Watches</h2>
			<p class="text">
				I've recently become interested in watches/horology, I think they are the perfect intersection of art and engineering. I'm an avid reader of Hodinkee and generally a big fan of Jack Forster and Cara Barrett (her article on why all watches should be unisex is a must read).<br>
				(I have also had the rare experience of seeing a Datejust in an authorized dealer, I think that only happens once per lifetime.)

			<div class="block">
			<h2>Camp Kesem</h2>
				<p class="text">To put it simply, Kesem has my whole heart.<br><a href="https://www.campkesem.org/find-a-camp/camp-kesem-at-duke-university">Camp Kesem</a> is a national non-profit run by college students that supports children through and beyond a parent's cancer.</p>
				<p class="text">What exactly does that mean? Duke University's chapter provides a free week of summer camp to local children affected by a parent's cancer, as well as year round support and reunions. Seeing campers transform into the most confident and compassionate versions of themselves is truly magical, and Camp Kesem is one of the best organizations I've been a part of.</p>
				<p class="text"></p>
			</div>

			<div class="block">
			<h2>Sports and Stuff</h2>
			<p class="text">
				Duke men's basketball (only since 2017 aka the year I started at Duke)</tab><br>
				Rock climbing/bouldering (getting calluses on my hands makes me feel tough)<br>
				I love swimming (which I did in high school), running (slowly), and hiking (ideally when it's cold and there are no bugs)
			</p>
			</div>

			<div class="block">
			<h2>Hot Takes</h2>
			<p class="text"> 
				Mayonnaise is not that bad<br>
				Summer is the best season<br>
				How to Train Your Dragon has a great soundtrack to get hype to<br>
				There's nothing wrong with the word "moist"<br>
				The crust is the best part of pizza<br>
