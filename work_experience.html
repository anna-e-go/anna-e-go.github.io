			I was a software research and development intern at the R&D headquarters in Tel Aviv, Israel. My responsibilities were primarily developing features that customers had requested, which included research on how to do it (or if it was possible) and implementing the backend. 
			<p class="text">
				Some features I created:
			<br>
				Collect general IP and port data from numerous external APIs
				Query National Vulnerability Database for software version specific vulnerabilities
				Fetch and compare installed software versions (both backend algorithm and front end search functionality)

		<h2>School Year 2018-2019</h2>

			Computer Science Undergraduate Teaching Assistant
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			As a Duke CS UTA for both Intro to CS and Data Structures and Algorithms, I've held office hours, led a lab/recitation session, and graded assignments and exams. <br>My experience as a UTA has helped me understand, in depth, the data structures and algorithms covered in CS 201, and has also taught me multiple ways of explaining concepts. I've also had to collaborate and communicate with my co-UTA regarding preparation for lab, grading assignments, and covering for help hour shifts. <br>Furthermore, I've loved being able to help other CS students learn. There's nothing more rewarding than seeing the *click* in a student when they finally grasp a difficult concept.<br>Being a UTA has made me a more attentive student, more empathetic team member, and a better programmer.
